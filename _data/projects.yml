  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    * Worked with Team of Intel Scientist and Engineers in enabling implementation of organic flexible devices packaging. 
    * Conducted ANSYS simulation varying die-to-substrate geometry to predict thermal stresses associated with reliability and thermo cyclic loads
    * Coordinated and studied the feasibility of manufacturing Nanopaper based flexible substrate and published IEEE conference paper on findings
