    - Led discussion for conceptualizing of new design from sketching, to creating 3D models, analyzing manufacturing and assembly feasibility of electric
motor driven propulsion system.
    - Conducted CAD modeling, FEA-simulation, strength analysis, DFMEA for the structural components of the pod brake modules using ANSYS and
validated with thermal/vacuum chamber results.
- Developed processing tools to streamline collection of Mechanical test data using feature extraction technique and MATLAB deep learning toolbox.
- Co-Developed the pod/system architecture program which controls electromechanical devices using real time data from sensors (90+) onboard as
well as maintains/monitors the thermal state of the battery modules.
- Played integral part in creating and implementing focus groups within mechanical and business team to enhance efficiency in communication.
- Key achievement - Led investment round seeking $100,000 and ended up with little over 1million dollars in funding for pod development.
